# Federated Spatial Modelling
Federated spatial modelling algorithm for BLE nodes in a mesh network

The spatial algorithm is based on triangles that are being formed with other surrounding nodes. Their mutual connections are explored from every node's perspective. Each node forms its own spatial model, with proportionate spatial information.
